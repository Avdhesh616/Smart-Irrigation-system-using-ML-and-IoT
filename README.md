# Smart-Irrigation-system-using-ML-and-IoT
Smart irrigation systems that use IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms can help monitor soil moisture for better water management and crop productivity.  Cloud computing can also be utilized for remote data storage and processing, which eliminates the need for manual soil checking and minimizes crop damage from water supply failure.
